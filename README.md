# MetaboScape Database Downloader

A simple GUI to download publicly available databases for use with the annotation tool in MetaboScape. Spectral 
libraries ("SL") are downloaded as *.msp files. Target Lists ("TL") are downloaded in their source format and 
automatically converted to a MetaboScape compatible Target List based on the MetaboScape Target List template.

## Usage

Select a database from the dropdown menu and click the "Download" button. When a database is selected, its source will 
be shown below the dropdown menu for manual download.

## Disclaimer

Database download links are hardcoded and therefore, along with this tool, may break at any time if the database is 
no longer available via the source, the link/host has changed, or the database has been updated.
